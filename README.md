# Daleth — `@da-eb`

**SRE · DevSecOps · Software Engineer · Visual Storyteller**

*I keep systems alive, make infrastructure boring (in the best way),*  
*and capture the world through a lens when I'm not staring at dashboards.*

## `$ whoami`

I'm an SRE/DevOps engineer obsessed with building **resilient, observable, and secure systems** that just *work* — at 3am, at scale, under pressure. I believe good infrastructure should be invisible, and great engineering makes the complex feel simple.

When I'm not debugging a runbook or writing IaC, I'm behind a camera — professionally shooting photos and videos, finding the same eye for detail in both disciplines.

## `$ uptime --philosophy`

> *"Reliability is a feature. Security is a requirement. Everything else is negotiable."*

I treat every system like it will fail — and build it so that when it does, nobody notices.
